# Spam Email Detector
Learning based project for AI

## Overview
The Spam Email Detector is a Python-based application that uses machine learning to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham). This project employs the Naive Bayes algorithm, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks.

- Outputs probabilities for each classification.
- Supports a large dataset with high-dimensional features.
- Fast training and prediction times.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for analysis)
- CSV for data storage

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas scikit-learn
  ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spam-Email-Detector.git
   cd Spam-Email-Detector
   ```

2. Place your `spam.csv` file in the `data/` directory.

## Algorithm Overview
Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm for classification tasks, particularly in scenarios like spam detection, due to several key advantages:

### 1. **Simplicity and Efficiency**
- **Easy to Implement:** Naive Bayes is straightforward to implement and understand, making it accessible for beginners and efficient for practical applications.
- **Fast Training and Prediction:** It performs well with large datasets, requiring quick counting of feature occurrences for training.

### 2. **Effective with High Dimensional Data**
- **Handles Many Features:** Suitable for text classification tasks with high-dimensional feature spaces.

### 3. **Good Performance with Limited Data**
- **Works Well with Small Datasets:** Effective even with smaller datasets, especially under the independence assumption.

### 4. **Probabilistic Nature**
- **Output Probabilities:** Provides class probabilities, useful for understanding uncertainty in predictions.

### 5. **Independence Assumption**
- **Assumes Feature Independence:** Simplifies computation, though real-world correlations can impact accuracy.

### 6. **Robustness to Irrelevant Features**
- **Handles Irrelevant Features Gracefully:** Ignores non-contributing features in high-dimensional spaces.

### 7. **Real-world Applications**
- **Widely Used:** Applicable in various domains, especially in natural language processing.

### Limitations
- The independence assumption can lead to inaccuracies with correlated features.
- Performance may degrade with highly imbalanced datasets.
